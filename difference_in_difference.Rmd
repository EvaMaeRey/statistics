Using a difference-in-difference framework to look at the effect of policy interventions is a popular research design.  A binary exlanatory variable that turns on and stays on lends itself to ease of interpretation!

In the context of such a design, what is the essential visual inspections?  Below I suggest four plots that researchers and their audiences may find useful in visually inspecting the timing of interventions and the relationships between a policy intervention and outcomes.

I use ggplot2 to implement the visualization. The ability to overwrite global aesthetics, using the aes() function, means that we move from one plot to another with little additional code.  A little over a year ago I learned about declaring the aes() on it's own line and maybe novelty bias is at work here, but I find the capability to be a lot of fun to play with!

The five plots are as follows:

- two plots showing the timing of intervention and the cross-sectional cases (one aligning the moments of interventions)
- two plots showing how the intervention relates to the response variable of interest (one aligning the moments of interventions)
- a plot that breaks up the data into individual time-series for the response variable for each cross-sectional unit

Another option for visualizing such data is using the new package [panelView](http://yiqingxu.org/software/panelView/panelView.html), which certainly gave me additional inspiration for this exercise and looks useful!

  mutate(intervention_year = runif(n = n(), 
                 min = min_year, 
                 max = max_year + span)) %>% 
  mutate(intervention_year = ifelse(max_year < intervention_year, 
                                    NA, 
                                    intervention_year)) %>%
