# Statistical independence

> In probability theory, two events are independent, statistically independent, or stochastically independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other.

--

> Similarly, two random variables are independent if the realization of one does not affect the probability distribution of the other.

---
## "A statistically significant relationship"

- When you have *evidence* of statistical *dependence*. 

--

- When the probability of observing of observing such a strong relationship --- or stronger --- under *statistical independence* (the null) is quite small.  

--

- How small is small enough?  It depends what $\alpha$ is... .01, .05, .1?

## Hypotheses

Hypothesis testing:

- A null hypothsis: $Ho$ (Often statistical independence)
- Alternate hypothesis: $Ha$ (Statistical dependence)

---
## Rejecting the null hypothesis

- Comparison will be made with expectation about null (often no relationship).  Such a strong relationship is unlikely to be observed by chance in a sample, if there is *not* dependence.  

---

- If data deviates from expecations given null (if observed relationships very surprising given null)

--

   - we reject the null (there is no relationship - statistical independence)

--

   - and accept the alternative (there is a relationship - statistical dependence)

---
## P-Value

"The probability that, given the null, a relationship as strong or stronger than that observed, would be observed."

# Inception: Lady tasting tea insight

- "null hypothesis"
- "statistical significance" (at significance level, alpha level)
- Test: "Fisher's exact"

# Players

Phycologist (algae studies) Muriel Bristol:  Prefered milk poured first.

Ronald Fisher - mathematically astute, but problematic

# The experiment

- 8 cups
- randomly fill 4 with milk first, 4 with tea first
- ask Bristol to identify which four milk and which for tea first
- assess evidence that Bristol can tell what is poured first

---

How many does she need to get correct to provide good evidence that she can really tell the difference? 


---
# Null hypothesis and p-value

Ho - There is no relationship between my variables.  Statistical independence. 

--

p-value - "the probability that you would observe a relationship as strong as or stronger than the observed relationship, if no relationship actually exists (i.e. if the null is true)."


---

Fisher on the null hypothesis - "never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation."  *The Design of Experiments*


---
# Rejecting the null

If we reject the null hypothesis, $H_0$, then we accept the alternative hypothesis $H_A$, that there is a relationship between two variables. 

---
# Lab

- What might we have observed under the null
- Compare to actual result 
- Do we reject the null (establishing statistical significance)?

---
# Problem solving techniques

- Analytic: Hypergeometric distribution
- Computational: Simulation (lab)
